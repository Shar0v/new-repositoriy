New blood joins this Earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules

With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on, he's known
Ooh, a vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away

What I've felt
What I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
<<<<<<< HEAD
Never be
Never see
Won't see what might have been
=======
Never free
Never me
So I dub thee unforgiven
